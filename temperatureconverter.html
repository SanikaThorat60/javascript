<h2>What Is Celsius??</h2>
<p4>Celsius is a scale (sometimes called Centigrade) that is used in many countries as a unit of measurement for temperature. The Celsius scale was created by a Swedish astronomer called Anders Celsius. On the scale, 0 degrees (°) Celsius is the melting point of pure water at sea level, at normal pressure.</p4>
<hr>
<h2>What Is Fahrenheit??</h2>
<p5>
  Fahrenheit is a scale for measuring temperature, in which water freezes at 32 degrees and boils at 212 degrees. It is represented by the symbol ° F. By mid-morning, the temperature was already above 100 degrees Fahrenheit.

<p2>Celsius To Farenheit Conversion:</p2>
<p>°F equals °C multiplied by 9/5, plus 32<BR>

  °F = °C * 9/5 + 32<br>
  
 <h2>Formula to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit F = C x 9/5 + 32</h2>
</p>

<h3>How To Convert Celsius To Farenheit</h3>
<p3>
<ol>
  <li>Multiply degrees Celsius by 1.8 (or 9/5)</li>
  <li>Add 32 to the product from step 1</li>
</ol>
<h2>For example,</h2> to convert 21.5 degrees Celsius (centigrade) to degrees Fahrenheit, we plug our numbers into the formula as shown below:<br>

°F = (°C × (9/5)) + 325<br>

°F = (21.5 × (9/5)) + 32<br>

°F = (21.5 × 1.8) + 32<br>

°F = 38.7 + 32<br>

°F = 70.7
<br>
21.5 degrees Celsius is equal to 70.7 degrees Fahrenheit.<br>

This calculator will show the steps to solve the °C to °F formula so you know how make the conversion yourself.
